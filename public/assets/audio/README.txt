Place your game audio files in this directory.

For the starter template, you'll need the following audio files:
- jump.mp3: Sound effect for player jumping
- collect.mp3: Sound effect for collecting items
- explosion.mp3: Sound effect for explosions or game over
- music.mp3: Background music for the game

You can create these audio files yourself or use placeholder sounds during development.
